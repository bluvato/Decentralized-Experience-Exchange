# Introducing a decentralized lifestyle exchange on the Ethereum Blockchain #

## Problem : ##

People acquire assets in order to add value to their lives, from a pair of golf clubs, to a motorboat, to a classic 1969 Camaro. These are not the types of items or experiences that people typically want to expend the time or energy to market/rent, nor do they want to entirely sell these assets. The only realistic option is all or nothing -- hang on to your assets and enjoy them on occassion, or sell them and lose all their benefit.

## Solution : ##

Lifestyle Coin (LYF) and the Lifestyle Exchange (LYFE) is an exclusive coin for those people who want to trade experiences with each other, but want to hang on to their original assets (and their fiat currency). LYFE allows for the creation of new value in assets that previously had no practical earning potential, while unlocking new opportunities of exchange for rich lifestyle experiences. 

Say, for example, you have a jet ski in Miami. You want to find someone to make a trade for the use of your jet ski for a weekend while you get to borrow their Ferrari while you are taking a summer vacation in San Diego. Practically, it would be impossible for you to set up this kind of trade. 

Enter LYF, the token that fuels the marketplace for you to exchange lifestyle events. LYF allows for a decentralized exchange of high-value, low liquidity assets to be exchanged for each other.
