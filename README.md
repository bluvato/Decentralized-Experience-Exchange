Decentralized Lifestyle Exchange

Lifestyle Coin is for exclusive and rich people who want to trade experiences with each other, but value hanging on to their hard-earned currency and assets. Therefore, we create a token and platform that allows an exclusive network of rich technocrats to share in the fruits of each other’s labors. 

Say, for example, you have a jet ski in Miami. But you really want to take a weekend trip in a Ferrari. Without a marketplace for you to exchange gifts through a new token currency, there is no feasible way for you to trade your jets skis in for a Ferrari, unless you happened to know someone who exactly wanted to swap those assets. Of course, this is virtually unlimited different pairs and it is not feasible to find a buyer-seller on both sides of the exchange. 

Enter : the Lifestyle Coin.

Lifestyle Coin, LYF, will allow for people to trade experiences. Buy using a token, we provide liquidity for experiences that don’t have direct exchange pair built into the experience.

Take, for example, the age-old idea of a house swap. These exchanges allow someone to trade houses, for instance, someone in Baltimore might exchange houses with someone with a house in Paris. The problem with these sites are obviously liquidity -- can you quickly convert your house’s availability into using someone else’s house --, supply, and demand. And if you think about something as intangible as renting out someone’s jet skis or using someone’s Ferrari for a weekend, this is obviously hundreds if not thousands of times more problematic from a liquidity, supply, and demand perspective. If you have a more intangible asset other than something obvious like an apartment/condo/house (etner AirBnb), how can you effectively have a platform in order to trade these lifestyle experiences with someone else?

The LYF starts to solve these problems by creating a decentralized, non-fiat currency that allows people to exchange intangible experiences without resorting to fiat currency and exchange rates.
